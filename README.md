# SyncUP

Hi, my name is Philippe Edouard Loiseau.

And this is my Final Project from the Concordia Web Development Program, " Sync UP".

This website is a place where you can make friends and creates groups before events so that you can have more fun as a bigger group. The more the merrier right?

This idea came to me when I thought of Facebook Events.

 That feature lets you join events and lets your friends know that you're participating, so I thought of doing something similar.

With the help of the seat geek API, I was able to get the neccessary data to build my website. 

This is a MERN Stack project, so I'm using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js 

Hope you enjoy!

-Phil
